The goal of *scregclust* is to cluster genes by regulatory programs. To do so, clusters are associated with regulatory programs and target genes are allocated to clusters with best fitting regulatory programs.

A detailed description of the algorithm and an in-depth evaluation of its properties can be found in our pre-print on bioRxiv: [DOI 10.1101/2023.03.10.532041](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.10.532041 "Reconstructing the regulatory programs underlying the phenotypic plasticity of neural cancers")
