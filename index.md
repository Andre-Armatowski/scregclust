## Introduction

The goal of *scregclust* is to cluster genes by regulatory programs. To do so, genes are clustered into modules which in turn are associated with regulators. The algorithm alternates between associating regulators to modules and reallocating target genes into modules.

A detailed description of the algorithm and an in-depth evaluation of its properties can be found in our pre-print on bioRxiv: [DOI 10.1101/2023.03.10.532041](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.10.532041 "Reconstructing the regulatory programs underlying the phenotypic plasticity of neural cancers")
